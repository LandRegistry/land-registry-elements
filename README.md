# land-registry-elements

Initially this repo will comprise production ready HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the DRV beta. The eventual goal however is for this to be a central location for all tested, production ready UI patterns suitable for use in any public facing Land Registry products. It builds upon and extends the foundations set out in https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements as well as providing new UI patterns as required.

A demo is available at: [link to heroku]
