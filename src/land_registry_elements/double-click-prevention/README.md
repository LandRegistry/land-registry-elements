# Double click prevention

Prevent people double clicking on form buttons by adding a `data-double-click-prevention` attribute to form buttons.

_Note: Don't rely on this solely to protect your app from double clickers. With JavaScript off, someone could still double click - make sure your app can handle this without exploding!_
