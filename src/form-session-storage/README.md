Allows form fields to save their values to `sessionStorage` (See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)) ready to be retrieved again at a later point. For example, information stored on a login form such as an email address could be retrieved at a later date on a register form.
